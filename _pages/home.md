# Welcome to the MAIS Lab!

### Note: This site is not official. This is just for the test purpose!

This site is under construction now!

<!-- 
We are currently building up our instruments right in the center of Munich, in the *Sommerfeldkeller*, where Sommerfeld and Röntgen worked. We will exchange ideas with world class groups working in quantum physics, cold-atom many-body physics, and 2d quantum materials. We are also a proud member of the [SuperC consortium](https://superc2033.com/our-team/).

**We are looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)](https://www.allanlab.org/vacancies) **!** -->
